# Dragon Dust 

Dragon Dust is a simple infinite sidescroller game made in 48 hours during Nordic Game Jam 2019.

The goal of the game is to control a dragon flying inside a cave and avoid various randomly generated obstacles such as rock structures on the ceiling and bottom of the cave, narrow passages and metal nets. Some of them require the dragon to change its form into a small chain or a cloud of energy particles.

The game was created with the Unity game engine and C# programming language.
